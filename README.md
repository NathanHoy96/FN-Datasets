# FN-Datasets

This repository contains a collection of Fake News datasets that are popular in the research literature. Note that the focus are datasets that contain the full-text of the articles. As such, datasets such as LIAR and FNC-1 have been omitted either, for not containing the full-text or for being more focussed on what could be defined as click-bait rather than fake news.

URLs associated with each dataset are contained in .txt files in each folder of 'Original Downloads'.

The cleaned folder contains versions of the datasets that may have had two CSVs merged together with labels added (where 0 indicates 'Fake' and 1 indicates 'True'). Some columns may have also been dropped in these versions.
